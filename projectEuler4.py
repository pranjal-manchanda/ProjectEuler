Largest palindrome product

Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    Program uses Python's special slicing operator to reverse a string
        Pros: Faster

"""
Different approaches for isPal:
1. Recursion (Probably the slowest)
    # Base case- If string is down to 1 letter, return True
    if len(i) <= 1:
        return True
    # Return equality 
    else:
        return i[0] == i[-1] and isPal(i[1:-1])

2. Reversed:
    return i == "".join(reversed(i))

Different approaches for largestPal():
    Not entirely satisfied with using a brute force solution (even though it's simple and still pretty quick).
    Will try to find a better solution over time.
