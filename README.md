# ProjectEuler
A blend of Python, JavaScript, Java and C solutions to ProjectEuler problems database

### Introduction

Project Euler(<a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Link</a>) is a comprehensive and diverse database of programming challenges. It consists of around 650 problems as of June 2019 and is constantly adding more.
My goal (in progress) is to solve all of them in the most elegant and efficient way I can think of.
