# ProjectEuler
(Hopefully) Elegant solutions to Project Euler problems in different languages.

### Introduction

Project Euler(<a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Link</a>) is a comprehensive and diverse database of programming challenges. It consists of around 650 problems as of June 2019 and is constantly adding more.
My goal (in progress) is to solve all of them in the most elegant and efficient way I can think of.

### Approach

Obviously, this will be a "living" repository with code added (hopefully) frequently. Although I prefer Python, I may be working with or trying to learn new languages at different points in time. Therefore, I will incorporate a variety of languages to solve problems over the course of the project as a way of staying in touch with different languages.
